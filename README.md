# SALARY CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: 3 days_

The problem presented was to design a page which could take multiple employees data, including name, ID, job title, and salary and display it in a meaningful and useful way. Also to give a warning if the hypothetical companies monthly salary cost exceeded $20,000.

To solve this, I created fields where data could be entered with a button that would log the information into an array, which would then render that updated state to the DOM in a clean, readable table format. The monthly cost was created by looping over the array and calculating the cost from the annual salaries of all employees. The $20k warning is a function that puts the monthly cost in a backgound color of red.
